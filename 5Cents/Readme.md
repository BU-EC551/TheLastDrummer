The Last Drummer:
This project is build on Xilinx Nexys 3 board as a part of EC551 Advanced Digital Design with Verilog and FPGA Spring '15 course at Boston University.

Following are the steps involed in building this project on Nexys 3 using Xilinx IDE:
<1> Create a new project including all Verilog codes plus its ucf provided in the directory "Verilog codes"
<2> Synthesize the code
<3> Connect the VmodTFT using VHDCI Cable
<4> Connect the Piezo sensors to the FPGA using MSP430 Launchpad (Code ADC conversion has been provided here)
<5> Connect the speakers via PmodAMP2 to JTAG C-PORT of Nexys 3
<6> Program the FPGA
<7> Enjoy playing Piano and Drums!
